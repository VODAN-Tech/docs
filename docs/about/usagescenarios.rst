Usage Scenarios
***************

The **VODAN in a Box (ViaB)** toolset can be used in the following scenarios:

Data-entry only
---------------

In this scenario, only the VODAN DSW and its COVID-19 semantic data model are used as a data-entry tool. Users can fill in the DSW's web form with data to report COVID-19 cases. 

Normally, this scenario is indicated for the cases where metadata about the data does not need to be published.

Metadata publication only
---------------

In this scenario, only the VODAN FDP is used to publish the pandemic-related content. This option is indicated for the cases where data have already been captured and only the FAIR metadata about them need to be published.

Data could have been made available from other CRF-entry tools and extracted directly from databases of information systems such as electronic health record systems.

Data-entry and metadata publication (complete package)
---------------

In this scenario, the whole **VODAN in a Box** is used, covering the data capture, semantic data generation and metadata publishing.
